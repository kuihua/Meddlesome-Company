  - "Wait, you\u2019re Berry too? Then why did you keep messing up my plans?!"
  - Actually it was you who ruined the plans, I had it all figured out but someone
    kept getting in the way!
  - Oh, really? What was your plan then?
  - "I was going to get into the vault\u2013"
  - What, by throwing a smoke grenade?
  - "No, that was\u2013"
  - You set off the alarm?
  - "You\u2019re no better than me. Is that why you snuck into the lab and, what,
    drew on that guy's face? That's probably what woke him up!"
  - "Well, if you had knocked him out better, that wouldn\u2019t be an issue."
  - "In fact, if you hadn\u2019t knocked him out at all, there wouldn\u2019t have
    been anyone there to snitch on us!"
