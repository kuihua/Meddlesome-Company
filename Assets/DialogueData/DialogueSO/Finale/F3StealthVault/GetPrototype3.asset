  - ... That's not more important than the people.
  - (Damn it, I've been such a horrible person.)
  - This is Melon we're talking about. I don't know why we're so surprised about
    this coming from a company that experiments on humans.
  - But Melon is worse than I thought.
  - We can't let them release this. But we were here on a mission, remember?
  - Right!
  - With this as evidence of Melon's misdeeds, we can report them!
  - Let's bring this back to Berry!
