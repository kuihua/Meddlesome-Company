  - So...how did you get here?
  - I didn't read the terms and conditions so they threw me in here!
  - Do you know how to get out of here? Will you help us?
  - Well I do have information. At a price.
  - Are you serious?
  - That radio over on that table is annoying. Find a way to turn it off. It's undestructible.
  - Trust me, I tried.
  - Aright.
