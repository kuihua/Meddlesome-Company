  dialogue:
  - You must be Anthony. Welcome to Melon Corp. You can ask me about the rooms here.
  - Would I get any work devices? Like a phone?
  - "You\u2019ll be provided one in a few days. For now you will use the company
    computers here and familiarize yourself with our processes. "
  - "Now..., you wouldn\u2019t be a Berry user, would you? We don\u2019t take kindly
    to them \u2018round these parts."
  - "Of course not. Screw those guys. I\u2019ve been an avid Melon user since Day
    1."
  - "That\u2019s what I like to hear! Feel free to look around and ask questions."
