  dialogue:
  - (Someone is still here?!)
  - Ahem. What are you doing here?
  - "Uh\u2013- I\u2019m, um... my supervisor... sent me to retrieve... a USB. Yes,
    a USB!"
  - "He doesn\u2019t want to come in here because of the smell."
  - Oh I see...
  - (He believed it!)
  - "I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still here. I thought everyone left because of
    the smell."
  - "Ah, well, I\u2019m on clean-up duty. Someone has to clean the lab after the
    experiment.\r\r\n"
  - Right.
  - (Of course, why didn't I consider that?)
  - (I should remember his name, just in case.)
